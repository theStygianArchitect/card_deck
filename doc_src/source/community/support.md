## Library support strategy
 
Deck of Cards follows a
[rolling release strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_release). 
This means only latest release of Deck of Cards is supported.
This allows us to quickly address bug fixes and to expedite the addition of new features. This 
also enables the Deck of Cards community to maintain flexibility while adapting to workforce.

We understand this strategy may not fit everyone's development cycle and encourage 
people to pin there dependencies as required.
